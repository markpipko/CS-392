A simple bash script that provides the basic functionality of a recycle bin. In addition to moving files into the recycle bin directory, 
the script is able to list and purge the files that have been placed into the recycle bin. This script acts as a substitute for the rm 
command, giving the user a chance to recover files deleted accidentally.
